# DNA-NAND-Input-Generator

To generate another sequence using same progenitor input sequence, re-run program for different result using same parameters. 

By default, there will be two sequences generated:
The first sequence produced mismatch in first base pair 
The second sequence produced mismatch in last base pair


Usage:
```shell
marcellagrillo@Marcellas-MacBook-Air DNA-NAND-Input-Generator % python3 findPairs.py 
Please enter your sequence: CCTTTAGAT
CGAAATATA
GGAAATGTA
```
